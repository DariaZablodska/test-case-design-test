EXERCISE 1: DECISION TABLE

The behavior of a component can be described by the business logic
- The input consists of a card from a standard deck of playing cards
- The output consists of a numeric value derived from the card
- Red cards have positive (+) output
- Black cards have negative (-) output
- Each number card has a base value of the number on the card
- Each face card has a base value of 20
- If a number card has an even number double the base value
- If a number card has an odd number half the base value

1. Work out the Decision Table which represents this behavior
2. Work out a set of physical test cases which would cover the scenarios worked out in 1.
